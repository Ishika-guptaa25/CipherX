The Advanced Cipher Breaker System is a production-ready application that automatically identifies and decrypts classical ciphers (Caesar, Affine, Vigenère, Substitution, Rail Fence, Atbash, ROT13). The system combines frequency analysis, Index of Coincidence, chi-squared testing, and hill climbing optimization to achieve 85-100% accuracy. It features a professional web interface with visualization, automatic cipher detection, detailed metrics, and export capabilities. The project includes 1500+ lines of Python backend code, 3000+ lines of academic documentation, and viva-ready explanations—designed as a university-grade final-year project demonstrating cryptanalysis, software engineering, and algorithmic problem-solving.











or
